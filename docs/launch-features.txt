## Architecture Consideration Questions

- **Database Structure**: Should you use Firestore subcollections for tab data or separate top-level collections with channel references?
- **Real-time Performance**: How will you handle scaling real-time listeners when channels have 100+ active users?
- **Search Strategy**: Will basic Firestore queries suffice initially, or should you plan for Algolia integration from the start?
- **State Management**: Will React Context be sufficient, or should you consider Redux/Zustand for complex state coordination?
- **File Storage Strategy**: Should files be organized by channel, user, or date hierarchy in Firebase Storage?
- **Security Rules**: How granular should role-based permissions be (channel-level, feature-level, or document-level)?
- **Offline Strategy**: Which data should be cached locally, and how will you handle sync conflicts?
- **Notification Strategy**: Should you implement push notifications in MVP or defer to post-launch?
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Will this be web-first with mobile adaptation, or should you consider React Native for native mobile apps?
- **Monitoring and Analytics**: What metrics are critical to track from day one (user engagement, message volume, feature usage)?
